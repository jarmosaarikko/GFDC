# GFDC
Global Forest Decimal Classification

GFDC source data is currently available under [Finto-data](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Finto-data/tree/master/vocabularies/gfdc)

Currently the editorial platform is being planned to be on [GFDC wikibase](https://forest-decimal-classification.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page)
The data would be reposited here. Data comprises of the two datasets:
- the class categories with notation and captions
- vocabulary of concepts with links to the corresponding categories

Additional repositories may be AgroPortal or EcoPortal.
The classification forms a part of the UDC classification **630 Forestry** with the notations 630\*0..630\*9 

Part of the UDC numbers are published as UDC Summary with the "Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 3.0 license".
GFDC numbers and captions are published with the same license.
